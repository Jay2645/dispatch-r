# Dispatch-R

Dispatch-R is a model railroad automation software, similar to JMRI.

Note that this software is currently unfinished! There is no guarantee that things will work at all. For the time being - [stick with JMRI](https://www.jmri.org/).

## What it does

Dispatch-R is planned to be able to manage several aspects of your model railroad:

* Locomotive rosters, including indicating which locomotives are consisted together. (**Not made yet**)

* Programming decoders, similar to JMRI. (**Not made yet**)

* Layout control, including throttles, switches, etc. (**Not made yet**)

* CTC control built-in. (**Not made yet**)

* Automatic train manifest generation, with support for add-ons such as RFID chips inside the train cars. (**Not made yet**)

* WiThrottle support. (**Not made yet**)

* Connections to your smart home and IOT devices via software like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or protocols like MQTT. (**Not made yet**)
